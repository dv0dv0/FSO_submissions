Web programmers oath

Programming is hard, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier

    I will have my browser developer console open all the time

    I progress with small steps

    I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpointing problems

    If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead I will start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working

    When I ask for help in the course Discord channel or elsewhere I formulate my questions properly, see here how to ask for help
